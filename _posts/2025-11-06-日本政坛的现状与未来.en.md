### The Current State and Future of Japanese Politics

Behind Japan's fawning is a gamble on war in the Asia-Pacific.

Have you noticed that Japanese politics has been a bit strange in recent years? Fumio Kishida, known for his stable political style, and Shigeru Ishiba, who acknowledged the need to face and reflect on history, both announced their resignations shortly after taking office. The newly elected Sanae Takaichi is arguably the most typical pro-American, anti-China hawk in Japan. We can see this clearly from her intimate body language with Trump; her attitude is one of humility and enthusiasm, completely fawning over the US as if it were her "second parent" (再生父母), verbally obeying Trump's every word with a smile on her face, while signing a pile of "sucker" (冤种) agreements. A stack of what can only be called lopsided agreements.  

From our perspective, it is hard to understand. Japan is still an economy of substantial scale; it shouldn’t need to act this deferential. But from the viewpoint of Japan’s right-wing leaders, the picture looks different. They are not surrendering—they are enduring and waiting for history to repeat itself.

Remember what happened the last time. After Japan’s unconditional surrender in 1945, only five years passed before the Korean War erupted. The United States was dragged deep into conflict in East Asia, and Japan immediately became the arsenal of the U.S. military-industrial supply chain. Defense contracts poured in “like rainfall from the heavens,” reviving Japan’s economy at high speed. As the U.S. grew exhausted, it adjusted its policy toward Japan. The Self-Defense Forces were established, the security treaty was rewritten, and when the first economic white paper was released, Japan’s golden era had begun.

So what are Japan’s right-wing strategists thinking now? It is very simple: they are betting that East Asia will see war within the next decade. They are betting the United States will again be drawn into a regional quagmire. They are betting Japan can once more profit after the war, even if they themselves do not win. Their goal is not victory—it is survival and advantage at the right moment.

However, the situation today is fundamentally different. This time, the central actor in East Asia is not the United States—it is China. China’s rise challenges the existing global leadership. More importantly, China is proposing a new narrative for global development—the concept of a “community of shared future for mankind.” This naturally meets resistance: pressure from the United States, and hostility from neighboring countries unwilling to accept a reshaped hierarchy.

If China seeks to secure leadership and stabilize the global strategic landscape, the most effective method is not direct confrontation with the United States. Instead, it is to establish authority through a decisive regional conflict. And the most “suitable” opponent is clear.

As Professor Shen Yi succinctly put it:
“Whichever way you look at it, Japan is the most appropriate.”

First, Chinese people have no psychological barrier to fighting Japan.
Second, Japan was a defeated state in World War II, and China is one of the victorious Allied powers and a permanent UN Security Council member—striking Japan to defend the post-war order is legally and historically justified.
Third, Japan is the United States’ forward base in Asia—targeting Japan is effectively targeting U.S. strategic influence in the region.

If such a conflict were to occur, China would gain three major advantages:

Activate and scale its wartime industrial capacity, surpassing the United States militarily.

Establish authority—a victory over Japan would deter Western powers and signal clearly who leads the new East Asian order.

Force the United States to withdraw from the Asia-Pacific, changing the regional balance permanently.

Of course, the best outcome is still the avoidance of war. If the United States chooses to retreat from East Asia voluntarily and concedes regional leadership to China, Japan will almost certainly pivot immediately. This is a natural characteristic of Japan’s geopolitical behavior.

Do not forget — Shigeru Ishiba’s resignation speech already hinted that Japan has long prepared a “pro-China contingency plan.” Just like the China-Japan-Korea Free Trade Zone negotiations: paused in name, never withdrawn in reality.

So when you see Sanae Takaichi smiling, understand: this is not weakness.
It is endurance.
It is calculated patience.
They are not waiting for peace.
They are waiting for the next storm.
