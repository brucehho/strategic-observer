## How I Write (Methodology)

1. **Facts**: Traceable sources, primary data/authoritative reports prioritized.

2. **Judgment**: Provide falsifiable viewpoints, not emotions.

3. **Scenarios**: Baseline / Risk / Optimistic three scenarios.

4. **Action**: Provide "what to watch next."

## Finally

This is a long-term project. All articles will be iteratively updated according to the above structure.
