When the India–Pakistan aerial conflict concluded this May, it reinforced an old but often overlooked reality: **relations between states are driven by interests, not emotions.** The United States, Russia, China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and others all played their own strategic roles in this conflict. Their support or opposition was guided not by morality or sentiment, but by geopolitical and economic calculations. In this sense, the India–Pakistan conflict serves as a microcosm of the broader dynamics of great power competition. Ordinary observers must recognize the complexity of international politics and avoid oversimplified narratives.

### 🌍 A Reflection of Great Power Competition

The clash between India and Pakistan is not merely a bilateral dispute.

It is **a stage on which global powers project influence**.

Nations do not act based on friendship or shared values; they act to secure **strategic advantage**.

The involvement of the U.S., Russia, China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and even Ukraine, illustrates how India and Pakistan become **pieces on a larger geopolitical chessboard**.

Thus, judging international affairs purely in terms of right or wrong obscures the underlying realities of power.

### US, India, and Russia: The Subtle Triangle

The United States outwardly calls for peace, yet tacitly supports India under the banner of counterterrorism, aiming to **use India as a strategic counterweight to China**.

Russia, despite its stable ties with China, **leans toward India** on this issue to preserve influence in South Asia.

### Russia-India Relations: Strategy and Arms Sales

India is a key purchaser of Russian military equipment and a long-standing strategic partner. Strengthening relations with India allows Russia to:

- Maintain influence in South Asia,
- Balance U.S. and Chinese regional presence,
- Secure economic benefits through continued arms sales.

Israel also plays a quiet but important role as a **major arms supplier to India**.

### India-Pakistan Conflict: The Positions of China, Israel, and Ukraine

- **Israel supports India** due to weapons contracts and shared interests in countering Islamist militant groups.
- **China supports Pakistan**, not only because of their traditionally close partnership, but because the Kashmir region is tied to China's strategic security and the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor.
- **Ukraine supports Pakistan**, primarily to undermine India’s ties with Russia and signal dissatisfaction with India’s neutral stance in the Russia–Ukraine war.


### 🤝 **Pakistan–Ukraine Cooperation and Turkey’s Involvement**

Pakistan’s military cooperation with Ukraine, alongside **Turkey’s outspoken support for Pakistan**, highlights the layered nature of international alignments.

- Ukraine leverages this relationship to irritate both Russia and India.
- Turkey, prioritizing Muslim solidarity and geopolitical influence, provides military support to Pakistan and backs Islamabad’s stance on Kashmir to increase its visibility in the Islamic world.

### ⛽ **Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Competing Interests**

Saudi Arabia and Pakistan share deep historical ties—economic assistance and military cooperation strengthen their relationship.

Iran, despite its religious connections to Pakistan, maintains a **neutral but cautious** position due to sectarian differences and border security concerns.

Tehran fears any escalation could destabilize its own regional environment.

The UAE, Japan, and the EU largely **prioritize stability**—calling for restraint while avoiding firm commitments.

If forced to pick sides, many would lean toward India, but prefer to avoid open alignment.
