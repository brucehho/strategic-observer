**Who in this world hates America the most?
Only Japan and South Korea.
Given the chance, they would tear the United States apart—cleanly, completely, without mercy.**

And who does America fear above all?
No one else.
Only Japan and South Korea.
Should it ever retreat, weakened, back to the Americas,
the first thing it would do is take them down.

Do you think “Sanae” is merely performing for the cameras—
or is she truly laying the groundwork for war with “China”?
The answer is simple:
both.

On one hand, Japan fears China’s revival.
In the past century and more, it launched two invasions—
each time shattering China’s march toward modernization.
Now, China stands at the threshold of resurgence.
This is Japan’s last, best chance—perhaps its only one in this lifetime.
It knows full well:
once China rises in earnest, there will be no future for Japan as it is today.

On the other hand—
could Japan be planning to throw itself into the fire?
To detonate itself as a fuse, triggering a hot war between America and China,
dragging both giants into a conflict neither may wish for?
One is the power Japan fears most.
The other, the one it hates most.
By offering up its “one hundred million souls” in a final act of desperation,
it might hope to ignite the very war that could reset the global order.
It’s precisely the kind of gambit a fanatical, militarist state could imagine.

Just how deeply does Japan hate America?
Do you remember Shinzo Abe?
Why was he assassinated?
Three months after his death,
his younger brother—de facto commander of Japan’s military forces—
was suddenly struck down by an unexplained, catastrophic decline in health,
forced to resign before he could even stand.

The China–Japan–South Korea Free Trade Area was originally co-conceived
by Shinzo Abe and South Korea’s Roh Moo-hyun.
Behind Japan’s 2007 rate hike stood the Abe–Kishi clan—
a move that helped puncture the financial bubble in 2008.
Had America’s financial “health bar” not been so deep,
that blow alone might have cost it half its strength.

Why, then, have so many politicians and conglomerates in Japan and South Korea fought so hard?
For one reason only:
to break free from control—
and reclaim their own sovereignty.

In 1972, when the Bretton Woods system collapsed,
France sent a warship to Washington to redeem dollars for gold—
and it was Japan that quietly passed the intelligence making it possible.

From 1979 to 1982, as U.S. interest rates soared to 20%,
Japanese trading houses colluded with Jewish capital to short American industry.
This set the stage for the 1985 Plaza Accord—
engineered by America’s “redneck” proxies—
through which ruthless Jewish capital delivered a decisive blow to Japanese finance
and effectively castrated American manufacturing.

Throughout the 1990s,
America appeared unstoppable—victorious in every theater.
Yet behind the scenes, nearly every major U.S. manufacturing firm
was being acquired by foreign capital—
with Japanese investors claiming the largest share.

Thus, Japan’s “Lost Thirty Years” were also thirty years of monetary inflation—
a time when IPOs happened overnight,
and torrents of capital flowed outward to buy up American—indeed, global—industrial assets.
So deep is America’s dependence today
that it can no longer even maintain its own weapons
without relying on Japan.

To achieve this, Japan acted decisively:
In 1990, it raised rates and popped the dollar bubble.
In 1997, it did it again—and fled first,
leaving George Soros bitterly disappointed.
In 2007, it raised rates once more:
first bursting the post-2002 U.S. internet bubble,
channeling hot money into real estate,
then puncturing the dollar bubble anew.

Everything Japan has done has had one purpose:
to bring America to its knees.
After all, it remains the only nation on earth
to have suffered two atomic bombs.
Its hatred runs deep—very deep.

And yet—could America, for all its power, really be blind to this?
On the contrary: history shows that
“taking out Japan” is one of the few things
America’s rednecks, its white-suited elites,
and its little men in round hats have always agreed on.

Consider George Soros’s Quantum Fund—
it has tracked and hunted Japanese finance for decades.
Or Warren Buffett:
he began quietly accumulating stakes in Japan’s six great trading houses as early as 2020.
On paper, his holdings now stand at 8–12%.
How much lies beneath the surface? No one can say.

Those six trading houses are Japan.
They are not assets anyone can simply buy.

So tell me—
how far has the struggle between America and Japan already gone?
